## Introduction

A financial analyst's time is valuable â€“ it shouldn't be wasted performing manual data entry. finreportr is a web scraper written in R that allows analysts to query data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission directly from the R console.  It aims to eliminate time wasters from a financial analyst's workflow, such as navigating the SEC EDGAR database, flipping through financial reports, and parsing XBRL-encoded data.

finreportr allows you to fetch data from the SEC and load it into your workspace using the following commands:
* `CompanyInfo()`: returns basic information about a company
* `AnnualReports()`: returns a listing of annual reports filed by a company
* `GetIncome()`: returns the income statement for a given company
* `GetBalanceSheet()`: returns the balance sheet for a given company
* `GetCashFlow()`: returns the cash flow statement for a given company

To install CRAN release version of finreportr:

```
install.packages("finreportr")
```

To install bleeding-edge version from GitHub:

```
devtools::install_github("sewardlee337/finreportr")
```

## CompanyInfo()

`CompanyInfo()` returns the following information about a given company based on its stock ticker symbol:
* Company Name
* [Central Index Key ("CIK")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Index_Key)
* [Standard  Industrial Classification ("SIC")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Industrial_Classification)
* State Location
* State of Incorporation
* Fiscal Year End (ddmm)
* Street Address
* City, State, ZIP

#### Arguments:

`CompanyInfo(symbol)`

where

* `symbol` is a character string that represents the relevant stock ticker symbol.

#### Examples:

```
> CompanyInfo("GOOG")

      company        CIK  SIC state state.inc FY.end            street.address             city.state
1 GOOGLE INC. 0001288776 7370    CA        DE   1231 1600 AMPHITHEATRE PARKWAY MOUNTAIN VIEW CA 94043

1 Facebook Inc 0001326801 7370    CA        DE   1231 1601 WILLOW ROAD MENLO PARK CA 94025
```


## AnnualReports()

`AnnualReports()` returns a dataframe that summarizes a given company's annual reports based on its stock ticker symbol. Information returned include:
* Filing Name

`AnnualReports()` will return data relating to a company's [Form 10-Ks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10-k.asp) if the company is domestic, and [Form 20-Fs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-20-f.asp) if the company is foreign. 

#### Arguments:

`AnnualReports(symbol, foreign = FALSE)`

where

* `symbol` is a character string that represents the relevant stock ticker symbol.
* `foreign` is a logical indicating whether the company in question is domestic or foreign.  `foreign` is set to `FALSE` by default.

#### Examples:

```
> AnnualReports("GOOG")
